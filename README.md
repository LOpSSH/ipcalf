It's <http://ipcalf.com>!!!

I really have no idea either, but it's like the other animals only more minimal. IP Minanimal if you will, as a dot com.

Oh and also it does content negotiation!

Use it in shell scripts:

    echo `curl -s http://ipcalf.com/?format=text`


Or in JavaScripts:

    fermata.json("http://ipcalf.com/").get(function (e,d) { console.log("Yay pointless cross-origin request:", d); })

Or in LISP:

    (ok (i dont actually know) lisp)


## Bonus

Go to [net.ipcalf.com](http://net.ipcalf.com) in a WebRTC-capable browser to see your local network IP address.
